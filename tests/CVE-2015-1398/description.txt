Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Magento Community Edition (CE)
1.9.1.0 and Enterprise Edition (EE) 1.14.1.0 allow remote authenticated users
to include and execute certain PHP files via (1) .. (dot dot) sequences in the
PATH_INFO to index.php or (2) vectors involving a block value in the
___directive parameter to the Cms_Wysiwyg controller in the Adminhtml module,
related to the blockDirective function and the auto loading mechanism. NOTE: 
vector 2 might not cross privilege boundaries, since administrators might
already have the privileges to execute code and upload files.
