Incorrect access control in migla_ajax_functions.php in the Calmar Webmedia
Total Donations plugin through 2.0.5 for WordPress allows unauthenticated
attackers to update arbitrary WordPress option values, leading to site
takeover. These attackers can send requests to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php to call
the miglaA_update_me action to change arbitrary options on affected sites.
This can be used to enable new user registration and set the default role for
new users to Administrator.
