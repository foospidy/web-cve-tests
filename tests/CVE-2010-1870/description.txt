The OGNL extensive expression evaluation capability in XWork in Struts 2.0.0
through 2.1.8.1, as used in Atlassian Fisheye, Crucible, and possibly other
products, uses a permissive whitelist, which allows remote attackers to modify
server-side context objects and bypass the "#" protection mechanism in
ParameterInterceptors via the (1) #context, (2) #_memberAccess, (3) #root,
(4) #this, (5) #_typeResolver, (6) #_classResolver, (7) #_traceEvaluations,
(8) #_lastEvaluation, (9) #_keepLastEvaluation, and possibly other OGNL context
variables, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-6504.
