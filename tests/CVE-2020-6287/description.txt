SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (LM Configuration Wizard), versions - 7.30, 7.31, 7.40,
7.50, does not perform an authentication check which allows an attacker without
prior authentication to execute configuration tasks to perform critical actions
against the SAP Java system, including the ability to create an administrative
user, and therefore compromising Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of
the system, leading to Missing Authentication Check.
