PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in the fetchView function in the
Mage_Core_Block_Template_Zend class in Magento Community Edition (CE) 1.9.1.0
and Enterprise Edition (EE) 1.14.1.0 allows remote administrators to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in unspecified vectors involving the setScriptPath
function. NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries,
since administrators might already have privileges to include arbitrary files.
