Atlassian Crowd and Crowd Data Center had the pdkinstall development plugin
incorrectly enabled in release builds. Attackers who can send unauthenticated
or authenticated requests to a Crowd or Crowd Data Center instance can exploit
this vulnerability to install arbitrary plugins, which permits remote code
execution on systems running a vulnerable version of Crowd or Crowd Data
Center. All versions of Crowd from version 2.1.0 before 3.0.5 (the fixed
version for 3.0.x), from version 3.1.0 before 3.1.6 (the fixed version for
3.1.x), from version 3.2.0 before 3.2.8 (the fixed version for 3.2.x), from
version 3.3.0 before 3.3.5 (the fixed version for 3.3.x), and from version
3.4.0 before 3.4.4 (the fixed version for 3.4.x) are affected by this
vulnerability.
