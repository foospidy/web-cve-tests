The Apache Struts REST Plugin is using XStream library which is vulnerable and
allow perform a DoS attack when using a malicious request with specially
crafted XML payload. Upgrade to the Apache Struts version 2.5.16 and switch to
an optional Jackson XML handler as described here
http://struts.apache.org/plugins/rest/#custom-contenttypehandlers. Another
option is to implement a custom XML handler based on the Jackson XML handler
from the Apache Struts 2.5.16.
