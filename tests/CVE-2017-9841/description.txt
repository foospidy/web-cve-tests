Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php in PHPUnit before 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via HTTP POST data beginning
with a "<?php " substring, as demonstrated by an attack on a site with an
exposed /vendor folder, i.e., external access to the
/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php URI.
