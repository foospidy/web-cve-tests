vBulletin through 5.3.x on Windows allows remote PHP code execution because a
require_once call is reachable with an unauthenticated request that can
include directory traversal sequences to specify an arbitrary pathname, and
because ../ traversal is blocked but ..\ traversal is not blocked. For example,
an attacker can make an invalid HTTP request containing PHP code, and then make
an index.php?routestring= request with enough instances of ".." to reach an
Apache HTTP Server log file.
