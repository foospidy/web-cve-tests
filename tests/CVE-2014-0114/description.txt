Apache Commons BeanUtils, as distributed in lib/commons-beanutils-1.8.0.jar in
Apache Struts 1.x through 1.3.10 and in other products requiring
commons-beanutils through 1.9.2, does not suppress the class property, which
allows remote attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary
code via the class parameter, as demonstrated by the passing of this parameter
to the getClass method of the ActionForm object in Struts 1.
